On vacation mode tomorrow and the little 🐝is always wanting to carry our bags, so whipped up this little pouch so she doesn't feel left out. So much fun watching her carry it around, putting little trinkets inside. Within minutes she already had the drawstring figured out lol. Contact me if you want one for your little one too! Lots of colors available. $15.00, shipping included in 🇨🇦🇺🇸.
