Tranquility. Peace. Joy. An appreciation of boredom. An ability to embrace quietness and find beauty in the stillness. These are things I want for my little 🐝. Some days though, ooooh I have work to do in the role modelling of those qualities. So, for the day when words failed me and I got a little frustrated (albeit she poured sunscreen all over the house and then ten minutes after everything was all cleaned up she peeled off her diaper and pooped on the floor), I decided to create my hopes for her. I poured peacefulness, calm and understated beauty into this little design and it is one of my favourite creations ever!!! It was a way to remind myself, and a way to give her, a little bit of tranquil joy too. If you want one of these Tranquil Traveler Rompers, DM and let me know. I have a feeling you will love it just as much as we do! 🐝💞😎
